**> who am I and what do I do?** :sweat_smile:

Hey! I'm Eri, and welcome to my little corner. I love open source and am always striving to improve my coding skills.
I share that journey online to give others company along their journey and hopefully act as a source of encouragement along the way.

I'm working with an incredible team of developers at @charmbracelet building and a whole lotta libraries.

**> nerd stuff**

- Languages & ecosystems I work with: Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust
- Editor: Vim, btw
