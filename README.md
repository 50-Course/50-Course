**> who am I and what do I do?** :sweat_smile:

Hey! I'm Eri, and welcome to my little corner. I love open source and am not afraid of challenges. I am an experienced software engineer with hands-on experience ranging from solving core engineering problems in the HR tech, fintech/insure-tech/bank tech, communication to enterprise systems.

Outside work, I explore adventures that infuse creativity with imagination, with activities ranging from random story writing, character development, and sometimes concept-to-screen exploratory coding projects which allows me to explore languages and domains of interest such as [Rust](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3A50-Course+rust&type=repositories), [C/C++ low level systems)](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3A50-Course+language%3Ac%2B%2B+language%3Ac&type=repositories) , and lately Elixir.

Niche domains I am currently exploring: Payment Systems - ACH/Swift/ISO 20022, and Media Streaming/Processing Systems.

**> nerd stuff**

- Languages & ecosystems I work with: Python (primary ecosystem), Java, Go, JavaScript
- PDE: Vim, btw (and maybe emacs, someday)

**> the vibe?** :relieved:

write some code, chill, seek experiences, and enjoy life :v:

**> fun fact**

- am an avaition freak
