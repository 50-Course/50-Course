### @50-Course ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source

</div>

Let's talk about your next big idea, or how we can collaborate on something cool.
What have I been upto? Below are highlights of the projects having be working on recently or contributing to:

- `paycheck`: Financial application that puts your tradiditonal bank to shame! - I mean, figuratively!
  Paycheck started as a side-project in late 2020 in a small room, evolved over time, went through different phases of research and development, pivots and once almost got thrown away as an unworthy epiphany

- `pytest-distributed`: A fast alternative to `pytest-xdist` that cuts down test execution time on production pipelines

- `django-toggul`: Feature flag management tool for django applications

- `Horizon-wm`: A dead-simple, fast and reliable window manager for developers, designed perfectly for efficiency and ergonomy

Contributions are welcome on any of my projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.

I have been working on my Japanese language proficiency for over a year now, I understand basic Japanese conversations, and currently learning to read and write Hiranaga and Katakana.
