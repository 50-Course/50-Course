Are you building something cool for the community? drop by my dms and let's talk about it. What have I been upto? Below are highlights of the projects having be working on recently or contributing to:

- Paycheck: Financial application that puts your tradiditonal bank to shame! - I mean, figuratively! Paycheck started as a side-project
in late 2020 in a small room, evolved over time, went through different phases of research and development, pivots and once almost got thrown away
as an unworthy epiphany. 

- Pytest-destributed: A fast alternative to `pytest-xdist` that cuts down test execution time on production pipelines

- django-toggul: Feature flag management tool for django applications.

- Saiit

Contributions are welcome on any of my projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations. I am currently seeking help on
the following projects:

- Sticky: A simple, fast and reliable note-taking application for developers.

- Pytest-distributed: A fast alternative to `pytest-xdist` that cuts down test execution time on production pipelines

- ClockIn: A simple, fast and reliable time-tracking application for developers.

- Horizon-wm: A dead-simple, fast and reliable window manager for developers, designed perfectly for efficiency and ergonomy.
