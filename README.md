"...creating value and pushing limits..."

Experienced software engineer with hands-on experience ranging from solving core engineering problems in the HR tech, fintech/insure-tech/bank tech, communication to enterprise systems.

As a seasoned software engineer, I excel in architecting APIs, microservices, managing databases with a little bit of platform touch in the mix. My expertise in Python, Java, Go, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes allows me to build robust infrastructures. I stand out by collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration and deliver scalable solutions that align with business goals.

Outside work, you'd catch me exploring adventures that brings out me to infuse creativity with imagination, with activities ranging from story writing, character development, or even brownfield/greenfield exploratory coding projects which allows me to explore languages such as Rust, for example or even C#/DotNet.
