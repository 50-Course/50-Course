50-Course loves open-source, are you building something cool for the community, drop by my dms and let's 

Below are highlights of the projects having be working on recently or contributing to:

- Paycheck: Financial application that puts your tradiditonal bank to shame! - I mean, figuratively! Paycheck started as a side-project
in late 2020 in a small room, evolved over time, went through different phases of research and development, pivots and once almost got thrown away
as an unworthy epiphany. 

- Pytest-destributed: A fast alternative to `pytest-xdist` that cuts down test execution time on production pipelines

- django-toggul: Feature flag management tool for django applications.

- Saiit
