Are you building something cool for the community? drop by my dms and let's talk about it. What have I been upto? Below are highlights of the projects having be working on recently or contributing to:

- `paycheck`: Financial application that puts your tradiditonal bank to shame! - I mean, figuratively!
  Paycheck started as a side-project in late 2020 in a small room, evolved over time, went through different phases of research and development, pivots and once almost got thrown away as an unworthy epiphany

- `pytest-distributed`: A fast alternative to `pytest-xdist` that cuts down test execution time on production pipelines

- `django-toggul`: Feature flag management tool for django applications

- `Horizon-wm`: A dead-simple, fast and reliable window manager for developers, designed perfectly for efficiency and ergonomy

Contributions are welcome on any of my projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.

Ask me about:

    - Core engineering
    - Python ecosystem
    - Java/JVM ecosystem
    - JS/Node ecosystem
    - Mobile and Native development
    - Performance engineering
    - Dev Tooling

### Technologies I love

```lua

local languages = {
    'Python',
    'Java',
    'C/C++',  --  basic proficiency
    'Rust', --  basic proficiency
    'Lua',

I possess deep understanding of the linux ecosystem - internals, core utils and the command-line, and have used it as my primary development environment for over 5 years.
